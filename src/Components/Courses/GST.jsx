              <p>GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a unified tax system that replaces multiple indirect taxes in India like VAT, excise duty, and service tax. It aims to streamline the taxation process and create a unified market.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Features of GST:</strong><br />
                <strong>Single Tax System:</strong> Consolidates multiple taxes into one.<br />
                <strong>Destination-Based Tax:</strong> GST is applied at the point of consumption, not at production.<br />
                <strong>Wide Applicability:</strong> Covers all businesses and services, with few exceptions.<br />
                <strong>Input Tax Credit:</strong> Businesses can offset taxes paid on inputs against taxes collected on outputs.

              <h1>How GST Works</h1>
              <p>GST works by applying tax at every stage of the supply chain. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it operates:</p>
              <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> GST Registration<br />
                Businesses must register for GST once their turnover exceeds the prescribed limit for GST registration.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tax Collection<br />
                Businesses collect GST on the sale of goods and services and pay GST on their purchases.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Input Tax Credit<br />
                Businesses can claim an input tax credit for taxes paid on their inputs, which they can offset against taxes collected on sales.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Filing Returns<br />
                Businesses must file periodic GST returns, detailing sales, purchases, and taxes paid/collected.</p>

          </div>
